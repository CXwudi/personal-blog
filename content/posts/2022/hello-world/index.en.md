Hello world! Welcome to my blog.

<!--more-->

## Intro

Today I am very happy to announce that my blog is publicly available. üéâ

All contents and the site configuration are available at the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/CXwudi/personal-blog-source) too.

The blog has:

- Dark theme
- i18n
- Comment system
- RSS supports with full content

The blog is generated using Hugo using the beautiful Hugo theme [DoIt](https://github.com/HEIGE-PCloud/DoIt) (Sincerely thanks for [HEIGE-PCloud](https://github.com/HEIGE-PCloud) for maintaining this Hugo theme). The blog is hosted on Vercel, which is visible from China mainland. So in theory, friends from China mainland should be able to visit my blog without VPNs and proxies.

## Why do I need a blog?

I write posts, but only friends in WeChat Moments can see them. I really hope there exists a platform where all friends of mine from overall the world can see my posts. In another words, A WeChat Moments but globalized.
Not only that, I'd like to write in different language so friends from both China and Canada can read my post easily. That's why building a blog with i18n support becomes the best solution.
The only downside is the privacy concern. Since the blog is publicly available on the internet, you can‚Äôt share something sensitive or too emotional on the blog. Fortunately, I am not the type of person who like to share too much.

Well, talking about post writing, maybe some people would recommend: why not WordPress? Bilibili posts? Or Medium? Or Zhihu? Or whatever platform?

So here comes the second reason why I need to build my own blog, instead of using the existing platform. The harsh reality is that Internet has no memory. Take a look at the first section of [this article](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/733a3gDW2F8B65joRrypMw) (Unfortunately this article is in Chinese, but you can just use the browser‚Äôs built-in translation feature to translate these articles to English), posts you published just mean money and view counts for those service providers. Once the value is gone, they delete your posts for their convenience.
What's even worse is that [this article](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/oY2ITkqebpKeLS3QEYviVg) and [this sue case](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/367880098) (Unfortunately both are in Chinese as well) have pointed out: **You never owned your account!** Service providers like Google, Baidu have the absolute right of managing your accounts, and they can ban or delete your account whenever they want without notification (Now, I somehow understand why people are promoting Web3.0)

So how to gain back the true ownership of your contents? The answer is building your own blog, but can we avoid building a blog from scratch using plain JavaScript, HTML and CSS? Fortunately, yes! We have static site generators. The static site generator handles the generation of the source code of the your blog, so that you can focus on content creation without worrying about the code. (Well, you still need to spend effort to choose and setup the theme to you‚Äôre your blog look beautiful, but trust me, it is worth the time as there are many great themes with rich features you can choose from and configure.)

So now, service providers like GitHub, Vercel are there just to host what I provided to them to the internet. I still have a local copy of everything in my PC. Even though if one day, service providers banned my account or the accessibility to their service, I could easily switch to another service provider. There are many great alternatives of GitHub and Vercel. In the worst-case scenario, I can self-hosted my blog from my own home lab. Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, I am not promoting to share illegal contents or something violating the law, but who knows if one day your GitHub account would get banned for no reason and without any warning like [this post](https://v2ex.com/t/836086) and [this post](https://yuukoamamiya.github.io/p/%E5%85%B3%E4%BA%8E%E6%88%91%E8%A2%ABgithub%E5%B0%81%E5%8F%B7%E8%BF%99%E4%BB%B6%E4%BA%8B/).

## What contents am I going to post?

Just simply take a look at the [About page](/about/#about-this-blog) of this blog.

However, I can‚Äôt guarantee the frequency of posting. It's all depends on if I have a thought that is worth to share to everyone. Also, one post a month might already be a challenge for me. Anyways, feel free to follow my blog
