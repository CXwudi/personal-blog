Hello world! Welcome to my blog.

<!--more-->

## Intro

Today I am very happy to announce that my blog is publicly available, as well as the [source code](https://github.com/CXwudi/personal-blog-source) in the GitHub repository.

The blog has:

- Dark theme
- i18n
- Comment system
- RSS supports with full content

The blog under the hook, is generated using Hugo and the beautiful Hugo theme [DoIt](https://github.com/HEIGE-PCloud/DoIt) (Sincerely thanks for [HEIGE-PCloud](https://github.com/HEIGE-PCloud) for maintaining this Hugo theme). All source contents of my blog and the site configuration are hosted in the GitHub repository. Vercel is used to deploy my blog from the GitHub repository. In theory, my blog should be visible from China mainland too, as Vercel is visible from China mainland.

## Why do I need a blog?

I always hope there exists a platform where I can share posts to all friends of mine from overall the world. In another words, A WeChat Moments but globalized.
Not only that, I also hope the post can have different language so that both friends from China and Canada can read my post easily. So, creating a blog with i18n support becomes the best solution.
The only downside of having a blog is that you can’t share sensitive information or something too emotional on the blog because it is publicly available on the internet, whereas in WeChat Moments, only your friends can see your post. But this is not a big deal for me as I usually don’t share something too personal.

Well, talking about post writing, maybe some people would say: why not WordPress? Bilibili posts? Or Medium? Or Zhihu? Or whatever platform they recommended?

So here comes the second reason why I create my own blog. Take a look at [this article](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/oY2ITkqebpKeLS3QEYviVg), the first section of [this article](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/733a3gDW2F8B65joRrypMw), and [a sue case](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/367880098) (Unfortunately all articles are in Chinese, but you can just use browser’s built-in translation feature to translate these articles to English).
Do you think the content you post will last in internet forever? Do you think you really own the content you posted? Obviously, the answer to all these questions is No. In the current Web2.0 era, you don’t own anything. Service providers like Google, Baidu have the absolute rights of managing your accounts. (In fact, that is one reason why people promote Web3.0)

So how to gain back the absolute right of managing your own contents? The answer is writing your own blog. Can we avoid writing the blog from scratch using plain JavaScript, HTML and CSS? Fortunately, yes! We have static site generators. The static site generator handles the generation of the source code of the your blog, so that you can focus on content creation without worrying about the code. (Well, you still need to spend effort to choose and setup the theme to you’re your blog look beautiful, but trust me, it is worth the time as there are many great themes with rich features you can choose from and configure.)

So now, service providers like GitHub, Vercel are there just to host what I provided to them to the internet. I still have a local copy of everything in my PC. Even though if one day, service providers banned my account or the accessibility to their service, I could easily switch to another service provider. There are many great alternatives of GitHub and Vercel. In the worst-case scenario, I can self-hosted my blog from my own home lab. Now don’t get me wrong, I am not promoting to share illegal contents or something violating the law, but who knows if one day your GitHub account would get banned for no reason and without any warning like [this post](https://v2ex.com/t/836086) and [this post](https://yuukoamamiya.github.io/p/%E5%85%B3%E4%BA%8E%E6%88%91%E8%A2%ABgithub%E5%B0%81%E5%8F%B7%E8%BF%99%E4%BB%B6%E4%BA%8B/).

## What contents am I going to post?

Just simply take a look at the [About page](/about/#about-this-blog) of this blog.

However, I can’t guarantee the frequency of posting. It's all depends on if I have a thought that is worth to share to everyone. Also, one post a month might already be a challenge for me. Anyways, feel free to follow my blog
