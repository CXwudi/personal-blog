## Prerequisites

Before we get started, let's make sure you have access to the following site and services:

- [Niconico](https://www.nicovideo.jp/)
- [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/)

And also make sure you understand basic Japanese, or at least have a translator to read Japanese.

## The Main Idea

First off, let's all agree that Hatsune Miku and other Vocaloid products are essentially voice synthesizers. So neither does Hatsune Miku "personally" create nor own any music. The Vocaloid Producers, who adore Hatsune Miku, are the ones who write all of her Vocaloid songs.

Numerous Vocaloid songs were created during the Vocaloid history by various Vocaloid Producers. Some of these songs are famous and become the symbol of Vocaloid throughout the years.

So our idea is simple. Since it is those famous Vocaloid songs made the history of Vocaloid, we simply **listen famous Vocaloid songs** in chronological order. The important keyword here is **chronological order**. If we follow it, we should somehow get a feeling of how Vocaloid history goes.

Of course things can not be that simple by just listening songs. So if possible, when you listen a song and you like it, try to search about the Vocaloid Producer who made that song, or the wiki about that song, or any interesting story behind that song. We hope that by searching these information, we can **gather pieces of information and slowly build up the whole picture of Vocaloid history**.

{{< admonition type=tip title="Some helpful resources" open=false >}}
Here are some wiki that might be helpful for you to search a song:

- [Vocaloid Wiki](https://vocaloid.fandom.com/wiki/Vocaloid_Wiki)
- [Moegirl (Chinese)](https://zh.moegirl.org.cn)
- [„Éã„Ç≥„Éã„Ç≥Â§ßÁôæÁßë (Japanese)](https://dic.nicovideo.jp)

Here are some individual posts about the summary of Vocaloid history. Unfortunately, these posts are in Chinese only üò™, and these are old posts, but they are still helpful if you can use a translator like [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/en/chrome-extension):

- [VOCALOIDÂúàÁöÑÊïÖ‰∫ã](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/53643387)
- [VocaloidËØûÁîü‰ª•Êù•ÊÑè‰πâÈáçÂ§ßÁöÑÂàõ‰ΩúËÄÖÊúâÂì™‰∫õÔºü](https://www.zhihu.com/question/47488103/answer/119044265)

{{< /admonition >}}

So now, the real question is, where can we find these famous Vocaloid songs? Well, there are 2 ways.

## Way 1 - The Hall of Legend song list

Talking about a list of famous Vocaloid songs, [Hall of Legend](https://dic.nicovideo.jp/a/vocaloid%E4%BC%9D%E8%AA%AC%E5%85%A5%E3%82%8A) is the best candidate. It is a list of songs with 1,000,000 views on [Niconico](https://www.nicovideo.jp/). Here is the list of Hall of Legend:

{{< admonition type=warning title="About these lists" open=false >}}
Unfortunately, some of these lists are in Chinese only. If you know a better alternative site with Japanese or English, let me know in the comment below
{{< /admonition >}}

- [VOCALOID‰ºùË™¨ÂÖ•„Çä„ÅÆ‰∏ÄË¶ß](https://dic.nicovideo.jp/a/vocaloid%E4%BC%9D%E8%AA%AC%E5%85%A5%E3%82%8A%E3%81%AE%E4%B8%80%E8%A6%A7)
- [UTAU‰ºùË™¨ÂÖ•„Çä](https://dic.nicovideo.jp/a/utau%E4%BC%9D%E8%AA%AC%E5%85%A5%E3%82%8A)
- [CeVIO‰ºùË™¨ÂÖ•„Çä](https://dic.nicovideo.jp/a/cevio%E4%BC%9D%E8%AA%AC%E5%85%A5%E3%82%8A)

Similarly we have a YouTube version, but for ten million views: (because hitting 1 million in Youtube is too easy)

- [YouTube‰∏äÊí≠ÊîæÊï∞ÈáèË∂ÖËøá1000‰∏áÁöÑVOCALOIDÊ≠åÊõ≤](https://zh.moegirl.org.cn/VOCALOID%E7%A5%9E%E8%AF%9D%E6%9B%B2/YouTube%E6%8A%95%E7%A8%BF)

Nice, we have the song list, but hold on, there are soooooooo many songs üò± (800+ by the time of writing this post). We don't have the effort to listen all of them, don't we? So, we can sort the Hall of Legend song list based on various factors, and then based on your patient level, you (as a Miku fan) decide how many songs do you want to listen.

### Sorting the Hall of Legend song list

First, let's draw a table like following:

| time of achieving 1M views / publish year | 2007 | 2008 | 2009 | ... more years ...  | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |
| -------------------------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| <= 100 days |      |      |      | ...  |      |      |      |
| <= 365 days |      |      |      | ...  |      |      |      |
| <= 3 or 4 years (up to u decide) |      |      |      | ...  |      |      |      |
| the rest |      |      |      | ...  |      |      |      |

> The same table can be used for the YouTube list, but instead of 1M views, we use 10M views.

Basically, we divide the song list into cells based on release date and the time taken to reach 1M views (or 10M for YouTube, same applied for all "1M views" mentioned in the rest of this post). Next, we walk the table row by row. In each row, we walk the cell from left to right. In each cell, we find songs that satisfy the condition, and then we listen to them before moving on to the next cell. For example, the first cell is songs that released in 2007 and hit 1M views within 100 days.

Let's talk about the meaning of each row:

- **First Row**: These songs hit 1M views in the very short time (within 100 days). These songs have **great impact in the Vocaloid history**. Hence we should listen to them first before moving on to the next row. Some examples are [„É°„É´„Éà](https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm1715919), [ÂçÉÊú¨Ê°ú](https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm15630734), [Á†Ç„ÅÆÊÉëÊòü](https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm31606995), [‰πôÂ•≥Ëß£Ââñ](https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm34470195), and etc.
- **Second Row**: These songs hit 1M views within a year of time. A year of time tbh is still a short period. These songs, although are not as famous as the first row, usually becomes **the symbol in the year**. For example, [magnet](https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm6909505) from 2009, [Â§ïÊôØ„Ç§„Ç®„Çπ„Çø„Éá„Ç§](https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm21513190) from 2013, [Â§™ÈôΩÁ≥ª„Éá„Çπ„Ç≥](https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm30469574) from 2017, [„Åæ„Å´„Åæ„Å´](https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm40349788) from 2022, and etc.

  > For those who are inpatient, the first two rows together around 100~200 songs should be enough to give you a rough understanding of the Vocaloid history, but I still highly recommend you keep on going to the third row.

- **Third Row**: This row contains a lot of songs (maybe around 300~500?). These songs didn't reach 1M views in a short time, but still, that is 1M views. In this row, you will experience the **wide diversity of Vocaloid music style**, and see how different era in Vocaloid history have different style of Vocaloid songs. That's why I still highly recommend you finish listening to songs in this row.

Upon here, you should have a clear understanding of Vocaloid history. If you are still interested in listening more, you can continue the last row, but it is optional.

## Way 2 - Music Game

Just listening the Hall of Legend song list can be pretty tedious, even though we prioritize the list. So is there a more funnier way to listen Vocaloid songs? Fortunately, yes! Let's play music games üòÑ!

The idea is that, if a song is included in a music game, then such song should be quite popular. So, by playing music games, you get the fun while get known to some popular Vocaloid songs.

The disadvantage of this way is that you likely lose the chronological order of the songs, but it is no longer a big deal because getting fun is the more important thing here.

The first music game that any Miku fan **must** play (Yes, must play, I am serious) is:

- [Official series of ÂàùÈü≥„Éü„ÇØ -Project DIVA-](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatsune_Miku:_Project_DIVA)

But one is not enough, then choose **at least one** of the following music games to play:

- Fan-made Project Diva simulation like [PPD](https://projectdxxx.me/) or [Project HeartBeat](https://ph.eirteam.moe/). Or fan-made chart/mod for official Project Diva games which can be found in the [Project DIVA Modding 2nd](https://discord.gg/projectdiva) Discord server.
- [OSU](https://osu.ppy.sh/)
- [Project SEKAI](https://pjsekai.sega.jp/)

{{< admonition type=note title="About this section" open=true >}}
This section is not a comprehensive introduction of these music games. Please refer to whatever guidance you can find online of these music games.
{{< /admonition >}}

### Official series of Project DIVA

The best Vocaloid music game is Project Diva series with no doubt. This is an old series with a lot of title on PS series, Switch and PC. Here is the image of the Project Diva series.

{{<image src="unknown.png" caption="Brife summary of the Project Diva series" >}}

Basically, Project Diva series has 2 lines: The normal title series of Project Diva 1,2,ex,f1,f2,x and the arcade series like Project Diva FT,MegaMix,etc.

You just buy [Project Diva MegaMix+](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1761390/_Project_DIVA_MEGA39s/) (make sure you buy the VIP version to get all songs) on PC to get all 250+ songs in one buy.

If you want to listen these 250+ songs in a roughly chronological order, then you can just play old titles in the following order:

- Project Diva 1
- Project Diva 2
- Project Diva extend (must play)
- Project Diva f1
- Project Diva f2
- Project Diva x
  - This title can be optional if you have X Song Pack mode for Project Diva MegaMix+ or AFT (Arcade Future Tone). However, make sure you do play the song pack.

Project Diva 1,2,ex is PSP exclusive, while f1,f2 are available in PS3 or PSV only, and x is only available in PS4 or PSV only. Fortunately, for PC gamers, there exists mature PC simulators for replacement, [PPSSPP](https://www.ppsspp.org/) for PSP, [RPCS3](https://rpcs3.net/) for PS3, and [Vita3K](https://vita3k.org/) for PSV

Unfortunately, Project Diva is already a dead title. Although MegaMix+ is released in 2022, it is pretty much a refresh of Project Diva FT back in 2016 with only 10+ additional songs from 2017/2018. Therefore, the biggest problem of using Project Diva as the way to listen Vocaloid songs is that you will not be able to know new songs. Literally any songs released in 2020 and after are not included in Project Diva series.

Another big problem with Project Diva is that it only contains songs sang by Crypton Future Media's Vocaloid characters (Miku, Rin, Len, Luka, Kaito, Meiko), but other characters like GUMI, IA, V Flower, Una, Kafu, etc are also famous in Vocaloid history, and they have a lots of great songs too.

That's why playing one music game is not enough. We need a second one to fill these gaps.

### Fan-made Project Diva simulation or modding

<!-- In a very long time, Project Diva series were only available in PS console but not on PC. At that time, we did't ever have runnable simulators mentioned above. So some people made a -->
If you like the game play in Project Diva, and you don't want to leave Project Diva to listen new songs, then you can try one of the two Project Diva simulation:

PPD: The first and oldest simulation of Project Diva on PC. It has its own rich community, which creates a lots of chart that you can download from the [PPD official website](https://projectdxxx.me/score-library), and even now the community is constantly creating more charts. Now you might wondering there are so many charts which one should I play first. Well, that's totally up to you üòÅ because a song that worth to be made as a chart is already a quite popular song. Just be aware that there are also non-Vocaloid songs.

Project Heartbeat: A.k.a PH, a newer simulation with advance customization and features. You can find custom charts made by community from Steam Workshop. It can also import charts from PPD and Project Diva MegaMix+. Hence I personally prefer it over PPD.

Project Diva with mods: Instead of playing a simulation, you can also play Project Diva MegaMix+ on PC with mods. Just head toward [Project DIVA Modding 2nd](https://discord.gg/projectdiva) Discord server and find the mod you want. The modding community is very active and you can find a lot of mods there. Many of them are song packs that can enrich your song list in Project Diva MegaMix+.

### OSU

OSU is a very popular rhythm game. It is the hardest among all these 4 music games, but it is also the funniest if you really get into it. It is not Vocaloid specific. However, it still has a lot of Vocaloid songs. And just like PPD, OSU has a very rich and active community so you can expect constant release of new charts for Vocaloid songs.

Here I can provide you [Deardrop's Vocaloid song pack](https://deardrops.github.io/osu/), you just download them and extract into OSU and you are good to go.

{{< admonition type=warning title="About Deardrop's Vocaloid Song Pack" open=true >}}
The song pack is uploaded in BaiduNetdisk (like Chinese Google Drive), so you likely need a Baidu account before you can download this song pack

If you know any other Vocaloid song pack for OSU, please let me know in the comment below and I will include it here
{{< /admonition >}}

Unfortunately, this is the only Vocaloid song pack I can find, and it is not updated since 2015. However, you can always [search "Vocaloid" on OSU official chart site](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?m=0&q=vocaloid&sort=ranked_desc), and sort results by chart release date to get newest Vocaloid charts.

### Project SEKAI

I personally would not recommend this game but it is still worth to mention here. Despite the game said "featuring Hatsune Miku", it is not really featuring Vocaloid but whatever non-Vocaloid characters SEGA wants. The existence of Vocaloid characters in Project SEKAI is weak, and many people think that SEGA just using Vocaloid as a free tool to gain popularity for their game. However, remember what I said in [Project Diva section](#official-series-of-project-diva) that Project Diva series doesn't include songs released in 2020 and after, and you need one more music game? Well, Project SEKAI is actually the best candidate as it contains a lots of new songs, especially those [released in 2020 and after](https://www.sekaipedia.org/wiki/List_of_songs#Commissioned_songs).

However, Project SEKAI also only include songs from Crypton Future Media's Vocaloid characters, so it doesn't solve the problem of playing Project Diva only üò™.

The biggest problem with Project SEKAI is that, initially you only can play a few songs, and you have to watch the storyline of these non-Vocaloid characters to unlock more songs. Watching these storylines is very tedious and time-consuming. So I recommend you to just buy a second hand Project SEKAI's account somewhere that has majority of songs unlocked . Then you can play any songs freely.

Due to these two drawbacks, I would recommend if you can play any one of other music games mentioned above, then skip Project SEKAI.

## Way 3 = Way 2 + Way 1

Nothing prevent you from combining Way 1 and Way 2 together. You can start by playing Project Diva, either Project Diva MegaMix+ or those old titles I mentioned in the introduction of [Official series of Project DIVA](#official-series-of-project-diva). Then you can go to Way 1 and listen to songs that are not included in Project Diva. Chance is that Project Diva can save you a lots of time listening songs before 2017, so that you can focus on listening songs after 2017.

> This is also how I become knowledgeable in Vocaloid üòÇ

## Conclusion
