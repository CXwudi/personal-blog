## Prerequisites

Before we get started, let's make sure you have access to the following site and services:

- [Niconico](https://www.nicovideo.jp/)
- [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/)

And also make sure you understand basic Japanese, or at least have a translator to read Japanese.

## Way 1 - The Hall of Legend song list

Talking about a list of famous Vocaloid songs, [Hall of Legend](https://dic.nicovideo.jp/a/vocaloid%E4%BC%9D%E8%AA%AC%E5%85%A5%E3%82%8A) is the best candidate. It records a list of songs with 1,000,000 views on [Niconico](https://www.nicovideo.jp/). Here is the list of Hall of Legend:

Unfortunately, some of these lists are in Chinese only. If you know a better alternative site with English or Japanese, let me know in the comment below

Similarly we have a YouTube version, but for ten million views: (because hitting 1 million in Youtube is too easy)

- [YouTube上播放数量超过1000万的VOCALOID歌曲](https://zh.moegirl.org.cn/VOCALOID%E7%A5%9E%E8%AF%9D%E6%9B%B2/YouTube%E6%8A%95%E7%A8%BF)

Nice, we have the song list, but hold on, there are soooooooo many songs (600+ songs by the time of writing this post). We don't have the effort to listen all of them, don't we? So what should we do?

Well, we can prioritize the Hall of Legend song list based on various factors, and then based on your patient level, you (as a Miku fan) decide how many songs do you want to listen.

First, let's draw a diagram like following:

| time of achieving 1M views \ years | 2007 | 2008 | 2009 | ... more years ...  | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |
| -------------------------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| <= 100 days |      |      |      | ...  |      |      |      |
| <= 365 days |      |      |      | ...  |      |      |      |
| <= 3 or 4 years (up to u decide) |      |      |      | ...  |      |      |      |
| the rest |      |      |      | ...  |      |      |      |

> The same table can be used for the YouTube list, but instead of 1M views, we use 10M views.

Now, our prioritization is very simply: we walks the table row by row, from left to right. In each cell, we find songs that satisfy the condition, and then we listen to them before moving on to the next cell. For example, the first cell is songs that released in 2007 and hit 1M views within 100 days.

The first row is songs that hit 1M views in the very short time (within 100 days). These songs have great impact in the Vocaloid history. Hence we should listen to them first before moving on to the next row. Some examples are [メルト](https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm1715919), [千本桜](https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm15630734), [砂の惑星](https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm31606995), [乙女解剖](https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm34470195), and etc.

The second row is songs that hit 1M views within a year of time. These songs, although are not as famous as the first row, usually becomes the memory of the year the song belongs to. For example, [magnet](https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm6909505), [夕景イエスタデイ](https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm21513190), [太陽系デスコ](https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm30469574), [まにまに](https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm40349788), and etc.

The first two rows together will give you a good shape the Vocaloid history, but that's only around 100 songs, and I highly recommend you keep on going to the third row. In fact, most songs fall into this row. They didn't reach 1M views in a short time, but still, that is 1M views. Since this row contains a lot of songs, in this row, you can see how different era in Vocaloid history have different style of Vocaloid songs. The great diversity of music style is one of advantage of Vocaloid. That's why I still highly recommend you listen to songs in this row.

Upon here, you should have a clear understanding of Vocaloid history. If you are still interested in listening more, you can continue the last row, but it is optional.

Last thing to point out, when you listen one song, don't just only listen the song. It is better to also search about the song on the internet. Many songs have [interesting hidden stories](https://www.zhihu.com/question/47488103/answer/119044265) about the Vocaloid Producer, or the audience, or the whole Vocaloid society, or the influence. Remember, there are many Vocaloid Wiki websites around the internet to help you understand more about the Vocaloid history:

- [Vocaloid Wiki](https://vocaloid.fandom.com/wiki/Vocaloid_Wiki)
- [Moegirl (Chinese)](https://zh.moegirl.org.cn)
- [ニコニコ大百科 (Japanese)](https://dic.nicovideo.jp)

## Way 2 - Music Game

Just listening the Hall of Legend song list is pretty tedious, even though we prioritize the list. So is there a more funnier way to listen Vocaloid songs? Fortunately, yes! We have music games!

The idea is that by playing music games, you get the fun while get known to some popular Vocaloid songs.

The best Vocaloid music game is Project Diva series with no doubt. This is an old series with a lot of title on PS series, Switch and PC. 

While you can just buy [Project Diva MegaMix+](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1761390/_Project_DIVA_MEGA39s/) (make sure you buy the VIP version to get all songs) on PC to get all 250+ songs. I would recommend you to play old titles
