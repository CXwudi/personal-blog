## Prerequisites

Before we get started, let's make sure you have access to the following site and services:

- [Niconico](https://www.nicovideo.jp/)
- [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/)

And also make sure you understand basic Japanese, or at least have a translator to read Japanese.

## Way 1 - The Hall of Legend song list

Listening to famous Vocaloid songs is the quickest way to get familiar with Vocaloid.

Talking about a list of famous Vocaloid songs, [Hall of Legend](https://dic.nicovideo.jp/a/vocaloid%E4%BC%9D%E8%AA%AC%E5%85%A5%E3%82%8A) is the best candidate. It records a list of songs with 1,000,000 views on [Niconico](https://www.nicovideo.jp/). Here is the list of Hall of Legend:

{{< admonition type=warning title="About these lists" open=false >}}
Unfortunately, some of these lists are in Chinese only. If you know a better alternative site with Japanese or English, let me know in the comment below

- [UTAU‰ºùË™¨ÂÖ•„Çä](https://dic.nicovideo.jp/a/utau%E4%BC%9D%E8%AA%AC%E5%85%A5%E3%82%8A)

Similarly we have a YouTube version, but for ten million views: (because hitting 1 million in Youtube is too easy)

- [YouTube‰∏äÊí≠ÊîæÊï∞ÈáèË∂ÖËøá1000‰∏áÁöÑVOCALOIDÊ≠åÊõ≤](https://zh.moegirl.org.cn/VOCALOID%E7%A5%9E%E8%AF%9D%E6%9B%B2/YouTube%E6%8A%95%E7%A8%BF)

Nice, we have the song list, but hold on, there are soooooooo many songs (600+ songs by the time of writing this post). We don't have the effort to listen all of them, don't we? So what should we do?

Well, we can prioritize the Hall of Legend song list based on various factors, and then based on your patient level, you (as a Miku fan) decide how many songs do you want to listen.

### Prioritization

First, let's draw a diagram like following:

| time of achieving 1M views \ publish year | 2007 | 2008 | 2009 | ... more years ...  | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |
| -------------------------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| <= 100 days |      |      |      | ...  |      |      |      |
| <= 365 days |      |      |      | ...  |      |      |      |
| <= 3 or 4 years (up to u decide) |      |      |      | ...  |      |      |      |
| the rest |      |      |      | ...  |      |      |      |

> The same table can be used for the YouTube list, but instead of 1M views, we use 10M views.

Now, our prioritization is very simply: we walks the table row by row, from left to right. In each cell, we find songs that satisfy the condition, and then we listen to them before moving on to the next cell. For example, the first cell is songs that released in 2007 and hit 1M views within 100 days.

Songs in the first row hit 1M views in the very short time (within 100 days). These songs have great impact in the Vocaloid history. Hence we should listen to them first before moving on to the next row. Some examples are [„É°„É´„Éà](https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm1715919), [ÂçÉÊú¨Ê°ú](https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm15630734), [Á†Ç„ÅÆÊÉëÊòü](https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm31606995), [‰πôÂ•≥Ëß£Ââñ](https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm34470195), and etc.

Songs in the second row hit 1M views within a year of time. A year of time tbh is still a short period. These songs, although are not as famous as the first row, usually becomes the symbol in that year. For example, [magnet](https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm6909505) from 2009, [Â§ïÊôØ„Ç§„Ç®„Çπ„Çø„Éá„Ç§](https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm21513190) from 2013, [Â§™ÈôΩÁ≥ª„Éá„Çπ„Ç≥](https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm30469574) from 2017, [„Åæ„Å´„Åæ„Å´](https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm40349788) from 2022, and etc.

For those who are inpatient, the first two rows together around 100 songs should be enough to give you a good shape of the Vocaloid history, but I still highly recommend you keep on going to the third row. Songs in the third row didn't reach 1M views in a short time, but still, that is 1M views. Since this row contains a lot of songs (maybe around 200~400?), in this row, you will experience the wide diversity of Vocaloid music style, and see how different era in Vocaloid history have different style of Vocaloid songs. That's why I still highly recommend you finish listening to songs in this row.

Upon here, you should have a clear understanding of Vocaloid history. If you are still interested in listening more, you can continue the last row, but it is optional.

Last thing to point out, when you listen one song, don't just only listen the song. It is better to also search about the song on the internet. Many songs have [interesting hidden stories](https://www.zhihu.com/question/47488103/answer/119044265) about the Vocaloid Producer, or the audience, or the whole Vocaloid society, or the influence. Remember, there are many Vocaloid Wiki websites around the internet to help you understand more about the Vocaloid history:

- [Vocaloid Wiki](https://vocaloid.fandom.com/wiki/Vocaloid_Wiki)
- [Moegirl (Chinese)](https://zh.moegirl.org.cn)
- [„Éã„Ç≥„Éã„Ç≥Â§ßÁôæÁßë (Japanese)](https://dic.nicovideo.jp)

## Way 2 - Music Game

Just listening the Hall of Legend song list is pretty tedious, even though we prioritize the list. So is there a more funnier way to listen Vocaloid songs? Fortunately, yes! We can get known to Vocaloid by playing music games!

The idea is that by playing music games, you get the fun while get known to some popular Vocaloid songs. This is also the way of how I get known to Vocaloid initiallyüòä.

I recommend you choose **at least** one of the following music games to play:

- [ÂàùÈü≥„Éü„ÇØ -Project DIVA- series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatsune_Miku:_Project_DIVA)
  - Including Fan-maded Project Diva simulation like [PPD](https://projectdxxx.me/) or [Project HeartBeat](https://ph.eirteam.moe/)
- [Project SEKAI](https://pjsekai.sega.jp/)
- [OSU](https://osu.ppy.sh/)

### Project Diva series

The best Vocaloid music game is Project Diva series with no doubt. This is an old series with a lot of title on PS series, Switch and PC.

// TODO: think about how to introduce the modding in Project Diva MegaMix+, might recommend to play official chart before the modded chart

While you can just buy [Project Diva MegaMix+](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1761390/_Project_DIVA_MEGA39s/) (make sure you buy the VIP version to get all songs) on PC to get all 250+ songs. I would recommend you to play old titles
