## Prerequisites

Before we get started, let's make sure you have access to the following sites:

- [Niconico](https://www.nicovideo.jp/)
- [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/)

It's better if you can understand some basic Japanese, or use a translator to understand Japanese.

## The Main Idea

<!-- First off, let's all agree that Hatsune Miku and other Vocaloid products are essentially voice synthesizers. So neither does Hatsune Miku "personally" create nor own any music. The Vocaloid Producers are the ones who write Vocaloid songs with the love to Miku ♥.

Numerous Vocaloid songs were created during the Vocaloid history by various Vocaloid Producers. Some of these songs are famous and become the symbol of Vocaloid throughout the years. -->

Vocaloid has been around for 10+ years. Numerous Vocaloid songs were created by various Vocaloid Producers. Some of these songs are famous and become the symbol of Vocaloid throughout the years.

Therefore, **listening famous Vocaloid songs in the history** is the best way to get familiar with Vocaloid.

<!-- The important keyword here is chronological order. If we follow it, we should somehow get a feeling of how Vocaloid history goes. -->

Also, when you listen a song you like, try to search about the Vocaloid Producer who made that song, or the wiki about that song, or any interesting story behind that song. We hope that by searching these information, we can **gather pieces of information and slowly build up the whole picture of Vocaloid history**.

{{< admonition type=tip title="Some helpful resources" open=false >}}
Here are some wiki that might be helpful for you to search any event happened in Vocaloid history, or any information about a particular song:

- [Vocaloid Wiki](https://vocaloid.fandom.com/wiki/Vocaloid_Wiki)
- [Moegirl (Chinese)](https://zh.moegirl.org.cn)
- [ニコニコ大百科 (Japanese)](https://dic.nicovideo.jp)

Here are some posts about the summary of Vocaloid history, written by other people. Unfortunately, these posts are in Chinese only 😪, and these are old posts, but they are still helpful if you can use a translator like [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/en/chrome-extension):

- [VOCALOID圈的故事](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/53643387)
- [Vocaloid诞生以来意义重大的创作者有哪些？](https://www.zhihu.com/question/47488103/answer/119044265)

{{< /admonition >}}

So, where can we find these famous Vocaloid songs? Well, there are 2 ways.

## Way 1 - The Hall of Legend song list

Talking about a list of famous Vocaloid songs, [Hall of Legend](https://dic.nicovideo.jp/a/vocaloid%E4%BC%9D%E8%AA%AC%E5%85%A5%E3%82%8A) is the best candidate. It is a list of songs with 1,000,000 views on [Niconico](https://www.nicovideo.jp/). Here is the list of Hall of Legend:

{{< admonition type=warning title="About these lists" open=false >}}
Unfortunately, some of these lists are in Chinese only. If you know a better alternative site with Japanese or English, let me know in the comment below
{{< /admonition >}}

- [VOCALOID伝説入りの一覧](https://dic.nicovideo.jp/a/vocaloid%E4%BC%9D%E8%AA%AC%E5%85%A5%E3%82%8A%E3%81%AE%E4%B8%80%E8%A6%A7)
- [UTAU伝説入り](https://dic.nicovideo.jp/a/utau%E4%BC%9D%E8%AA%AC%E5%85%A5%E3%82%8A)
- [CeVIO伝説入り](https://dic.nicovideo.jp/a/cevio%E4%BC%9D%E8%AA%AC%E5%85%A5%E3%82%8A)

Similarly we have a YouTube version, but for ten million views: (because hitting 1 million views in Youtube is too easy)

- [YouTube上播放数量超过1000万的VOCALOID歌曲](https://zh.moegirl.org.cn/VOCALOID%E7%A5%9E%E8%AF%9D%E6%9B%B2/YouTube%E6%8A%95%E7%A8%BF)

Nice, we have the song list, but hold on, there are soooooooo many songs 😱 (800+ by the time of writing this post). We don't have the effort to listen all of them, don't we? So, we can sort the Hall of Legend song list based on various factors, and then based on your patient level, you (as a Miku fan) decide how many songs do you want to listen.

### Sorting the Hall of Legend song list

First, let's draw a table like following:

| time of achieving 1M views / publish year | 2007 | 2008 | 2009 | ... more years ...  | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 |
| -------------------------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| <= 100 days |      |      |      | ...  |      |      |      |
| <= 365 days |      |      |      | ...  |      |      |      |
| <= 3 or 4 years (up to u decide) |      |      |      | ...  |      |      |      |
| the rest |      |      |      | ...  |      |      |      |

> The same table can be used for the YouTube list, but instead of 1M views, we use 10M views, same applied for all "1M views" mentioned in the rest of this post

Basically, we divide the song list into cells based on release date and the time taken to reach 1M views. Next, we walk the table row by row. In each row, we walk the cell from left to right. In each cell, we find songs that satisfy the condition. For example, the first cell is songs that released in 2007 and hit 1M views within 100 days. Then we listen to these songs before moving on to the next cell.

So why do we make such a table? Well, let's talk about the meaning of each row:

- First Row: These songs hit 1M views in the very short time (within 100 days). These songs have **great impact in the Vocaloid history**. Hence we should listen to these songs first. Some examples are [メルト](https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm1715919), [千本桜](https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm15630734), [砂の惑星](https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm31606995), [乙女解剖](https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm34470195), and etc.
- Second Row: These songs hit 1M views within 365 days. A year of time tbh is still a short period. These songs, although are not as famous as the first row, usually becomes **the symbol in the year**. For example, [magnet](https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm6909505) from 2009, [夕景イエスタデイ](https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm21513190) from 2013, [太陽系デスコ](https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm30469574) from 2017, [まにまに](https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm40349788) from 2022, and etc.

  {{< admonition type=tip title="For those impatient" open=true >}}
  The first two rows together around 100~200 songs should be enough to give you a rough understanding of the Vocaloid history.
  
  For those who are impatient, you can stop by here, but I still highly recommend you keep on going to the third row if you can.
  {{< /admonition >}}

- Third Row: This row contains a lot of songs (maybe around 300~500?). It takes pretty long time for these songs to reach 1M views, but still, that is 1M views. In this row, you will experience the **wide diversity of Vocaloid music style**, and see how different era in Vocaloid history have different style of Vocaloid songs. That's why I still highly recommend you finish listening to songs in this row.

{{< admonition type=warning title="Please be aware of fake views in Niconico" open=false >}}
Some songs have fake views. In another words, some people use bots to massively increase the view count of a song.

To recognize songs with fake views, you can search the wiki of the song and usually it will tell you if the song has fake views or not. Another way of recognizing is to check the favourite count. You can suspect that **any song with 1M views but less than 1000 favourite count potentially has fake views**.

For example, [片恋歌](https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm37828204) has only around 100 favourite count, and [忘れちゃったよ。](https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm30968350) has less than 1000 favourite count. These two songs are known to have fake views.

In contrast, **in normal situation, a song that just reach 1M views usually have thousands of favourite count**.
{{< /admonition >}}

Upon here, you should be pretty familiar with Vocaloid and know decent amount of famous Vocaloid songs, and even have some understanding of the Vocaloid history. If you are still interested in listening more, you can continue the last row, but it is optional.

## Way 2 - Music Game

Just listening to the Hall of Legend song list alone may be quite tedious, even though we prioritize the list. So is there a more funnier way to listen Vocaloid songs? Fortunately, yes! Let's play music games 😄!

The idea is like this, **if a song is included in a music game, then such song should be quite popular**. So, by playing music games, you get the fun, and at the same time you get known to some popular Vocaloid songs.

The first music game that all Miku fans **must** play (Yes, must play, I am serious) is:

- [Official series of 初音ミク -Project DIVA-](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatsune_Miku:_Project_DIVA)

**And** choose **at least one** of the following music games to play:

- Fan-made Project Diva simulation like [PPD](https://projectdxxx.me/) or [Project HeartBeat](https://ph.eirteam.moe/). Or fan-made song packs added on top of official Project Diva games.
- [OSU](https://osu.ppy.sh/)
- [Project SEKAI](https://pjsekai.sega.jp/)

Let's talk about each music game briefly.

{{< admonition type=note title="About this section" open=true >}}
This section is not focusing on teaching how to play these music games. About the guide to a particular music game, please refer to whatever guide you can find online.

This section is more about how to use these music games to get familiar with famous Vocaloid songs.
{{< /admonition >}}

### Official series of Project DIVA

The best Vocaloid music game is Project Diva series with no doubt. Here is the image of the Project Diva series.

{{<image src="unknown.png" caption="Brife summary of the Project Diva series" >}}

#### Two options

If you prefer to have one title including all 250+ playable songs, play one of the following:

- [Project Diva MegaMix+](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1761390/_Project_DIVA_MEGA39s/)
  - Make sure you buy the VIP version
- [Project Diva AFT (Arcade Future Tone)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_2qbofpxz9dB7VgfS5WA1uahwE-jmQny55WEyCYedCQ)
  - you would need to install MegaMix song pack to get the missing 10+ songs exists in MegaMix+, checkout the X Song Pack in [Project DIVA Modding 2nd](https://discord.gg/projectdiva) Discord server

{{< admonition type=tip title="MegaMix+ vs AFT which one should I choose?" open=false >}}

| Features | Project Diva MegaMix+ | Project Diva AFT |
| --- | --------------------- | ---------------- |
| Is legal | Yes | No |
| AMD GPUs | Supported | Need patches |
| Advanced controller mapping. E.g. map one of each L1,L2,R1,R2 to one of each up,down,left,right | Unsupported | Supported |

{{< /admonition >}}

If you prefer to listen these 250+ songs in a roughly chronological order, then play these old titles in the following order:

1. Project Diva 1
2. Project Diva 2
3. Project Diva extend (most classic one, must play)
4. Project Diva f1
5. Project Diva f2
6. Project Diva x
    - This title can be optional if you have X Song Pack mode for Project Diva MegaMix+ or AFT. However, make sure you do play the song pack.

Project Diva 1,2,ex is PSP exclusive, while f1,f2 are available in PS3 or PSV only, and x is only available in PS4 or PSV only. Fortunately, for PC gamers, there exists mature PC simulators for replacement, [PPSSPP](https://www.ppsspp.org/) for PSP, [RPCS3](https://rpcs3.net/) for PS3, and [Vita3K](https://vita3k.org/) for PSV

#### Drawbacks of playing Project Diva only to listen Vocaloid songs

There are two problems if you just use Project Diva as the source of knowing Vocaloid songs:

1. **Not be able to know new songs**: Unfortunately, Project Diva is already a dead title. Although MegaMix+ is released in 2022, it is pretty much a refresh of Project Diva FT back in 2016 with only 10+ additional songs from 2017 to 2019. Songs released in 2020 and after are not included in Project Diva series at all.
2. **Exclusive to Crypton Future Media (CFM) Vocaloid characters only**: In another word. Project Diva only contains songs sang by Miku, Rin, Len, Luka, Kaito, Meiko. Other characters like GUMI, IA, V Flower, Una, Kafu, etc are not included, despite they are also famous in Vocaloid history and have a lots of great songs.

That's why playing one music game is not enough. We need a second one to fill these gaps.

### Fan-made Project Diva simulation or modding

<!-- In a very long time, Project Diva series were only available in PS console but not on PC. At that time, we did't ever have runnable simulators mentioned above. So some people made a -->
If you like the game play in Project Diva, and you don't want to leave Project Diva to listen new songs, then you can try the following 3 options:

1. **PPD**: The first and oldest simulation of Project Diva on PC. It has its own **rich community** that is constantly creating new charts, wzhich can be download from the [PPD official website](https://projectdxxx.me/score-library). Which charts should I play first? Well, that's totally up to you 😁 because a song that worth to be made as a chart is already a quite popular song. Just be aware that there are also non-Vocaloid songs.
2. **Project Heartbeat**: A.k.a PH, a newer simulation with advance customization and features. You can find community-made custom charts from Steam Workshop. It also **can import charts from PPD and Project Diva MegaMix+**. Hence I personally prefer PH over PPD.
3. **Project Diva with mods**: Instead of playing a simulation, you can also play Project Diva MegaMix+ on PC with mods. Just head toward [Project DIVA Modding 2nd](https://discord.gg/projectdiva) Discord server and find the mod you want. The modding community is very active and you can find **a lot of song packs** to enrich your song list in Project Diva MegaMix+.

### OSU

OSU is a very popular rhythm game. It's barrier is much higher, but you will find it very fun to play if you pass through that barrier. OSU is not Vocaloid specific, but it still has a lot of Vocaloid songs. Just like PPD, OSU has a very rich and active community so you can expect constant release of new charts for Vocaloid songs.

You can start by using [Deardrop's Vocaloid song pack](https://deardrops.github.io/osu/) as the starting point.

{{< admonition type=warning title="About Deardrop's Vocaloid Song Pack" open=true >}}
The link provides you a download link from BaiduNetdisk (like Chinese Google Drive). Unfortunately, you need a Baidu account to download this song pack.

If you know any other Vocaloid song pack for OSU, please let me know in the comment below and I can include it here
{{< /admonition >}}

Unfortunately, this is the only Vocaloid song pack I can find, and it is not updated since 2015. However, you can always [search "Vocaloid" on OSU official chart site](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?m=0&q=vocaloid&sort=ranked_desc), and sort results by chart release date to get newest Vocaloid charts.

### Project SEKAI

I personally would not recommend this game as many people including me have bad impression to Project SEKAI, but it is still worth to mention here.

Project SEKAI is made by SEGA and released in 2020, since then SEGA proactively organize song commission events. Thanks for these events, quite a lot of songs [released in 2020 and after](https://www.sekaipedia.org/wiki/List_of_songs#Commissioned_songs) become members in the Hall of Legend song list. Of course, all of these songs are included in Project SEKAI. So playing Project SEKAI can help you to get known to newer songs which Project Diva doesn't have.

Unfortunately, Project SEKAI also only include songs from CFM Vocaloid characters, so it doesn't solve the problem of playing Project Diva only 😪.

Another problem with Project SEKAI is that, initially only a few songs are unlocked. To unlock more songs, you have to go through storylines of these non-Vocaloid characters, which is tedious and time-consuming.

Finally, Project SEKAI is a mobile game. So expect pay-to-win elements and Gacha in this game.

Due to these drawbacks, I would recommend to avoid Project SEKAI if possible, but if you really want to stay in Project SEKAI, I recommend you just to buy a second hand Project SEKAI's account that has majority of songs unlocked to save yourself some times on unlocking songs.

## Way 3 = Way 2 + Way 1

Nothing prevent you from combining Way 1 and Way 2 together. You can start by playing Project Diva, then you go to Way 1 and listen to songs that are not included in Project Diva. Chance is that Project Diva can save you a lots of time listening songs before 2017, so that you can focus on listening songs after 2017.

> This is also how I get familiar in Vocaloid 😂

## Summary

Basically, you have two options to get familiar with Vocaloid. You can either listen famous Vocaloid songs in a priorities way, or you can play music games. Of course, you can combine both of ways together if you want.
