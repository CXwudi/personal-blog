For any new Miku fan who just come to the Vocaloid society, listening to famous Vocaloid songs in the history is the best way to know more about Miku and Vocaloid. But hold on, there are soooooooo many Vocaloid songs. We don't have the effort to listen all songs. What should we do?

Well, in this post, I'd like to introduce you 2 ways to quickly get familar with Vocaloid and Miku.

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, let's make sure you have access to the following site and services:

- [Niconico](https://www.nicovideo.jp/)
- [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/)

And also make sure you understand basic Japanese, or at least have a translator to read Japanese.

## Way 1 - The Hall of Legend song list

[Hall of Legend](https://dic.nicovideo.jp/a/vocaloid%E4%BC%9D%E8%AA%AC%E5%85%A5%E3%82%8A) is a list of songs that have exceeded 1,000,000 views on [Niconico](https://www.nicovideo.jp/). Hitting 1 million views is the memoriable moment. Hence songs with such achievement are good candidates for new Miku fans to get known of popular songs in Vocaloid community. And here is the list of Hall of Legend:

Similarly we have a Youtube version, but for ten million views: (because hitting 1 million in Youtube is too easy)

(Unfortunately, only this Chinese fan site has a most accurate recording)

Nice, we have the song list, but there are sooooooooo many songs. Let's not worry about the Youtube list as it has many songs repeated in Niconico list. The Niconico list has 600+ songs (by the day of writing this post). Not all Miku fans have the patient to listen all 600+ songs . So can we do something faster?

Well, today I am going to teach you a smart way to selectively listening the Hall of Legend song list. Any Miku fans, any level of patient can fit into this way of listening.

First, let's draw a diagram like following:

|                                   | 2007 | 2008 | 2009 | ... more years ...  | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |
| -------------------------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| < 100 days or reached 10 millions |      |      |      | ...  |      |      |      |
| < 365 days |      |      |      | ...  |      |      |      |
| < 3 years () |      |      |      | ...  |      |      |      |
| the rest |      |      |      | ...  |      |      |      |
